On this page, we'll answer some of your Frequently Asked Questions. 

## 1. Can the client be modded?
No, the client is not able to be modded, although the Client will not have control over how the game and the UI looks.

The server decides the visuals, more like the "Resource Packs" available in Minecraft. The server decides what mods are used 

## 2. What Network Protocol will be used?

Hytale will use the QUIC transport protocol. 

For context, the two main Internet protocols are UDP and TCP.
- UDP is connectionless, fast, fire-and-forget packets but has less reliability as packets can be lost.
- TCP is connection-based, slower than UDP, can guarantee packet delivery with much more reliability.
Both are pretty fast in modern times, games can run fine on both (but generally prefer UDP).

QUIC is a **hybrid protocol** that builds off UDP to get the same speed benefits, but adds some layers of reliability like TCP.
Essentially, a solid choice for game development that blends speed and reliability.

## 3. What are Transport Packets?

Hytale will support transfer packets which can send players to other servers with a small payload for tokens/encrypted data.
- Equivalent of BungeeCord in Minecraft
- Mainly for large server networks

There is no middleman, you connect directly to Server A. When you want to switch, Server A says “Here is a 4kb ticket w/inventory and stats. Go to server B”
Leads to massive cost reduction which can be spent on devs instead of servers

## 4. Will Hytale support dedicated servers?
Yes, Hytale will support dedicated servers. This allows server owners to host their own Hytale servers on their own hardware or through third-party hosting services.
 
Dedicated servers provide more control over server settings, mods, and performance compared to using official hosting solutions.

## 5. Will Hytale support modding on consoles?
As of now, Hytale modding is primarily focused on PC platforms.
