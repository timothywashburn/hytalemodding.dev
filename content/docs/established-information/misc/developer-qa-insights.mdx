description: Technical insights from Hytale developers Zero and Slikey about the game's architecture, modding capabilities, and development approach.
---

This page summarizes technical information from a developer Q&A session with **Slikey** and **Zero** from Hypixel Studios. The information focuses on the technical architecture, modding capabilities, and development philosophy behind Hytale.

## Modding Architecture

### Server-Side Java Plugins

Hytale's modding system is built around **Java plugins** that run server-side. This provides developers with extensive control over game functionality.

- **Java 21+ Required**: Plugins must compile for at least Java 21, but the game ships with a Java 25 JVM
- **Full Server Control**: Server plugins can do anything standard Java applications can do
  - Database connections
  - Web requests and API integrations
  - Machine learning implementations
  - Custom libraries and frameworks (including Lua scripting if desired)
- **No Remote Code Execution**: Clients do NOT download executable code from servers for security reasons. Only configuration and assets are downloaded
- **Highly Customizable**: Most of the core game can be changed - you could theoretically create a completely custom adventure mode with no vanilla content

### Asset-Based Modding (No Code Required)

For creators who don't want to write Java code, Hytale offers powerful data-driven modding:

- **JSON Configuration**: Add NPCs, items, crafting recipes, and more by modifying JSON files
- **In-Game Tools**: Use built-in creative mode tools to create content without coding
- **Visual Scripting**: A sandboxed visual scripting system will replace traditional command blocks for asset packs
- **Free and Open**: All modding tools are included with the base game - no paywalls or partnership requirements

## Server Source Code Sharing

One of Hytale's most significant features is the **shared source server** model:

- **Release Timing**: Server source code will be released shortly after game launch (pending legal finalization)
- **Shared Source Format**: The source code will be:
  - Completely unobfuscated
  - Include all developer comments
  - Available for reading and modification
- **Custom Server Software**: Technically skilled developers can create entirely custom server software (e.g., Rust implementations)
  - Must maintain protocol compatibility with the latest client version
  - Full control over server behavior and performance
- **Documentation Access**: Developers can browse the source code directly, supplementing the public GitBook documentation

## Network and Protocol

### QUIC Protocol

Hytale uses the **QUIC protocol** for networking:

- **Modern Standard**: QUIC is a modern transport protocol built on UDP
- **Potential Issues**: Some governments block QUIC, which could affect players in certain regions
- **Current Data Layer**: Uses a custom serialization format that the team plans to replace post-launch
- **Protocol Documentation**: Will be available when the shared source is released

### Server Discovery

- **Launch**: Servers accessible by direct IP at launch
- **Post-Launch**: Server discovery system planned for after release to improve player and server owner experience

## World Generation and Performance

### Chunk Management

- **Automatic Unloading**: Chunks and entities unload when outside all players' render distance to conserve RAM
- **Multi-Threading**: Mixed approach for server performance
  - Each world runs on its own main thread for core logic
  - Parallel execution available for certain tasks
  - Designed to utilize multi-core machines effectively

### World Generation

- **Powerful Algorithm**: Sophisticated world generation with extensive tooling
- **Creative Building**: Create impressive structures in creative mode and share as "prefabs"
- **Prefab System**: Advanced prefab system with an in-game editor
- **No Code Required**: Create custom biomes and world features without writing Java
- **Detailed Blog Post**: A dedicated world generation blog post is being written

### NPC Systems

- **Living World**: NPCs interact dynamically (e.g., bears attacking deer)
- **Faction Support**: Adventure mode will feature faction interactions
- **Herd Behavior**: System supports flocks/groups of NPCs that stay together
- **Configurable**: Requires configuration time but offers powerful customization options

## Graphics and Rendering

### Current Technology

- **OpenGL 3.3**: Current graphics API, chosen for Mac compatibility
- **Art Style Commitment**: The team is committed to maintaining the current art style
- **Hardware Accessibility**: Designed to run on affordable hardware and support more platforms
- **Future Considerations**: Potential move to Vulkan/Metal in the future (long-term possibility)

### Lighting Engine

Current improvements in progress:

- **Model Lighting**: Models currently only have a single light value; working toward gradients like full blocks
- **Light Consistency**: Fixing differences between static lights (placed torches) and dynamic lights (held torches)
- **Voxel Integration**: Addressing lighting inconsistencies between models and voxels

## User Interface

### NoesisGUI Integration

Hytale is transitioning to **NoesisGUI** for UI customization:

- **Client-Side Only**: NoesisGUI is exposed only on the client side
- **Abstraction Layer**: Developers use Hytale's abstraction over NoesisGUI, not direct SDK access
- **Community Feedback**: System designed to be powerful and react to community needs
- **Nameplate Potential**: NoesisGUI transition may make nameplates more customizable
- **Custom UI System**: Add elements to the HUD using the custom UI system
- **Status Effects**: System supports buffs/debuffs (nameplate customization currently limited)

### Current Limitations

- **Lack of Super Custom UI/Input**: Recognized as a current limitation
- **Invasive Mods**: Custom shaders and VR support are problematic without proper sandboxing
  - Must maintain server-side compatibility
  - VR support not possible anytime soon

## Development Tools

### Blockbench Plugin

Hytale originally developed "Hytale Model Maker" but switched to Blockbench:

- **Industry Standard**: Blockbench became the de-facto standard for block game modeling
- **Partnership**: Partnered with Blockbench creator Jannis
- **Features**: Supports both modeling and animation
- **Release**: Will be available before or at game launch
- **Internal Use**: Hypixel Studios uses it internally

### Machinima and Cinematics

- **Cinematic Tools**: Sophisticated tools for creating cinematics
- **Proven**: The 2018 Hytale announcement trailer was created using these tools
- **Available at Launch**: Players can create machinima content from day one
