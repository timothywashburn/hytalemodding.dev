description: A library providing Kotlin utilities for Hytale

<Callout>
This is a community-maintained project started by [Seraphina](https://github.com/xshley) and [oglass](https://github.com/oglass)

Kytale provides many utilities for making using Kotlin with Hytale seamless.

While we wait for a server JAR containing the Hytale API, we have many items on our roadmap.

### Kytale Roadmap
- DSLs
  - UI DSL - Multiple prototypes are underway using some example UI code provided by user Ktar on X
  - Unknown - We're still waiting for more information from Hytale, but we'll add more as we can
- kotlinx.coroutines support - When Hytale releases, we'll evaluate if we need anything to better support coroutines
- kotlinx.serialization support - (de)serializers for Hytale types to provide integration with kotlinx.serialization

Kytale will be published on Maven Central under
- `io.github.hytalekt:kytale:version`
- `io.github.hytalekt:kytale-coroutines:version`
- `io.github.hytalekt:kytale-serialization:version`

This should make it so that if you don't need support for serialization/coroutines, you won't have to include it.
