# Introduction

An Entity Component System otherwise known as ECS is a design pattern in game development.

ECS is made up of Entities, which reference Components and Systems that operates on Entities.

It also focuses on composition over inheritance, eliminating rigid hierarchy, helps separate behavior and data and makes reusability easier.

# Composition Over Inheritance

Before getting into understanding what ECS is made of, lets understand what is the ECS philosophy.

We can describe composition as "has X" and inheritance as "is X".
When we inherit a class in Java, we inherit all of its attributes and methods.
While in composition we can choose for each object what it references and what systems will work on it.

# Entities, Components and Systems

## Entities

An Entity is just a unique identifier.
- It contains no data.
- It contains no logic

Think of entities as nouns that can be described using components

## Components

Components are just plain data containers.
- They store only data
- They contain no behavior or logic
- They describe traits or aspects of an entity

Examples of components:
- A 'Position' component that stores X, Y and Z coordinates
- A 'Velocity' component that stores the speed along each axis
- A 'Health' component that stores the current health of the entity

Think of components as adjectives that describe an entity

## Systems

Systems contains the logic for your game (or in this case, a mod).
- It Operates on all entities that have a specific set of components
- It Does not store entity data itself
- It Applies behavior by reading and modifying component data


For example:
- A "WinConditionSystem" may process every Entity that contains the components "Position" and "Velocity"
- If an entity reaches the position `(0, 0, 0)`, the system will trigger a "You Won!" message.
