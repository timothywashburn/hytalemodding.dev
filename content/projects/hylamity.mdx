Hylamity is a mod that incorporates content in Terraria and the Calamity Mod.
Early development focuses on containing content found in Calamity, recreated items and mobs using 3D models replicating the Hytale style.

- Content is design to fit in the world of Hytale
- Weapons will be unique and have their own identities
- Items are balanced with Vanilla to allow smoother compatibility
- Additional Vanilla and Modded content will also be included, such as Fargo's Souls
- Some content is redesigned in such a way to be unique from the mod/game

## Wulfrum Update

As the first update to the mod, Wulfrum gear and enemies will be added.
A prefab known as the Wulfrum Workshop will spawn around the world, containing all the Wulfrum robot enemies that work together to gather resources.
Aligning with Hytale's living world system, eventually the behavior of these robots will resemble that of a factory assembly.
Wulfrum armor is reworked to support and empower all weapon types, not limiting to a single class.
Cut content from Calamity such as the Wulfrum Bow and Pickaxe will make a return. This goes for future content as well.

### Future Content

As Hytale develops and its tools expand, no idea is off limits! We will be adding multiple biomes, bosses, weapons, crafting materials and more in the future.
Almost all bosses will be added eventually, and some even getting redesigned to incorporate new ideas. Hylamity may also contain content from Vanilla Terraria and the Fargo's Souls mod.
Permissions from the owner of Calamity and Fargo have been granted to develop these projects. Stay tuned for more!
